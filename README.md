# CS167: Notebook 0
For all notebooks, I will include the instructions in the README.md file (the file you see when you open up a repository on GiHub, which you are reading right now). 

Most Notebooks will also have starter code in the resository (which you can generally see in the section above this text). The starter code generally provides a push in the right direction as well as some organization for the assignment. However, this assignment doesn't really have any code associated with it, so it will just live as a README file.
